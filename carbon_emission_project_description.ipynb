    "> **Overview**  \n",
    "This project focuses on predicting carbon dioxide (COâ‚‚) emissions using data-driven techniques. By analyzing historical environmental and industrial data, we aim to build a machine learning model that forecasts future carbon emission trends. These insights can be used to support sustainable decision-making and climate policy development.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Objectives:**\n",
    "- Explore and clean carbon emission datasets  \n",
    "- Visualize emission trends over time  \n",
    "- Apply machine learning models to predict future emissions  \n",
    "- Evaluate model performance and draw actionable insights  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Tools & Technologies:**  \n",
    "`Python`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Scikit-learn`, `Jupyter Notebook`\n"
